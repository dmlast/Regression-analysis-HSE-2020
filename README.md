# Regression-analysis-HSE-2020
My completed homework assignments for the regression analysis course from the HSE Department of Economics.  

*  **Homework 1** was devoted to manual verification of statistical tests: constructing a confidence interval for the variance of a sample with an unknown mean of the general population, testing the hypothesis of independence of signs using the chi-square criterion.
*  **Homework 3** was focused on testing hypotheses of equality of means, constructing confidence intervals for the means, implementing basic linear regressions, and testing the hypothesis that $R^2 = 0$ (that the model is insignificant)
