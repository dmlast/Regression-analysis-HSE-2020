# Regression-analysis-HSE-2020
My completed homework assignments for the regression analysis course from the HSE Department of Economics.  

*  **Homework 1** was devoted to manual verification of statistical tests: constructing a confidence interval for the variance of a sample with an unknown mean of the general population, testing the hypothesis of independence of signs using the chi-square criterion.
*  **Homework 3** was focused on testing hypotheses of equality of means, constructing confidence intervals for the means, implementing basic linear regressions, and testing the hypothesis that $R^2 = 0$ (that the model is insignificant)
*  **Homework 4** was focused on the implementation of the solution of the clustering problem in R. For the solution, we implemented data preprocessing in R, tested different clustering methods and different distance metrics, and selected the optimal number of clusters.
*  **Homework 5** was focused on margin effects estimation in R for multimodal distributed variables
*  **Homework 6** was devoted on the implementation of the principal component method in R and its theoretical interpretation. For this assignment I chose the results of social surveys on the perception of democracy in Kazakhstan. I managed to identify two components that can be oriented as pro-American and pro-Russian part of Kazakh society. We can conclude that Kazakh society is significantly polarized.
*  **Homework 7** was about factor analysis realization in R
